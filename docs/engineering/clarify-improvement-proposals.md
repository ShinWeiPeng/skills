## SPEC visibility and execution

In every project, the agent establishes and presents the current SPEC before
program changes. Each completed SPEC or reconfirmed revision appears in the reply
with its ID, title, clickable canonical link, scope summary or revision delta, and
authorization status. Opening a panel or saving a file is not a substitute.
The agent waits for your explicit `開始執行`; choosing an option or adding a
requirement does not authorize implementation. A later scope change returns to
SPEC discussion and fresh authorization. SPEC writing may continue while product
changes are paused. This shared plugin workflow does not require project reminders
and does not claim to intercept arbitrary host tools.

## What it does

`clarify-improvement-proposals` turns an underspecified improvement request into a decision-complete proposal with explicit impact, tradeoff, and validation evidence. It does not silently choose among unresolved product or architecture options.

## When to reach for it

Type `/clarify-improvement-proposals`, or Codex reaches for it when you ask how to improve, refactor, compare, or redesign something. Reach for it before implementation when the requested destination is still ambiguous.

## Decision completeness

Its leading idea is **clarify first**: inspect discoverable facts, ask only for conclusion-changing choices, and keep the proposal blocked until those choices are resolved.

Choice presentation stays in the current mode. Unanswered required choices remain pending without a deadline, including when a tool closes or times out. A mode change is relevant only when a completed proposal is actually ready for implementation; it is never an answer or approval.

## Where it fits

This is the proposal gate before architecture and implementation. [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes modifying engineering work through it when risk requires a proposal.

## Discussion remains active while execution is paused

Across new and existing projects, accepting a requirement updates the current SPEC
before implementation. A pause stops product work while later decisions continue
to be recorded. Routing success never grants write permission. Managed delivery
binds explicit execution evidence to the current project, task and specification,
and checks it inside each supported file replacement. Direct host tools remain
outside that boundary; real assistant traces are required in addition to unit tests.

See the [managed delivery contract](https://github.com/ShinWeiPeng/skills/blob/main/skills/engineering/implement/references/managed-delivery.md)
for request examples, supported operations and evidence limits.

## Decisions in the current mode

Default/execution mode must not invoke menu tools, including async questions.
Use numbered text only when host rules permit it; otherwise persist and ask one
concise open text question. Already-active Plan may use a permitted menu after
shared question-policy preflight. Questions have no response deadline. Neither a timeout nor selecting an option grants
execution permission. Higher-priority host interaction rules still apply.

Every SPEC revision, including editorial changes and reconfirmation with no
semantic change, requires a fresh `開始執行` covering that revision. Discussion
continues to update SPEC while product work waits. Final evidence updates also
end the previous permission; subsequent product work needs fresh authorization.

## Keep discussion moving

An answer can also contain a scope correction and a technical question. The
workflow handles all three, saves decisions to SPEC, and presents the next
unresolved question in the same turn. Pure factual follow-ups return to the saved
unanswered choice. Waiting requires a presented question, a concrete blocker,
your request to pause discussion, or a complete proposal awaiting authorization.
The completion check uses existing SPEC state and observed presentation evidence;
it does not control the app's final-response behavior or grant execution permission.

Question feedback and alternative revisions remain in the existing SPEC journal.
A failed popup is not automatically resent; changed options receive a new version
before display. Prepared reply checks and actual emitted reply audits are separate;
accepted tool requests and presentation files do not prove visible delivery.

## Discussion is saved from entry

Engineering work automatically starts or resumes a task-specific working record,
including diagnosis and code explanation. Grilling manages that discussion while
specialist skills provide facts. Questions are reserved for decisions the user
must make. A saved explanation does not need a formal SPEC; an adopted change with
complete scope and acceptance does. Suggested changes remain candidates until
accepted and do not expand authorization.

The candidate plugin includes prompt, resume, pre-tool and Stop hooks. Review and
trust their exact definitions before activation. Missing discussion can trigger
one automatic continuation for an actual input state. Unchanged failures do not
loop, and restarting does not erase retry history. Failed saving reports the missing
scope and ends the reply normally; discussion and recovery can continue. After a
repair, saving and rechecking can succeed in the same task. Product changes still
require a current SPEC and execution authorization. Reply wording differences do
not count as missing requirements. Script tests alone do not prove desktop hooks were loaded
or fired. The covered tool paths are Bash, exec_command and file edits; other tools, hosted
search, streamed text and interruptions have explicit coverage limits.

## Bounded diagnosis and recovery

Separate discovered skill names, callable CLI capabilities and actual check
verdicts. `test-validation-layout` resolves to the validated `architecture_cli.py
layout` result; a callable FAIL or BLOCKED remains a failed or blocked check.
An explicit caller capability limit is never expanded by discovery.

A blocker records category, original evidence, affected branch, repair suggestion,
authorization requirement, reproducible recheck, success condition and resume target.
Investigate discoverable facts and prepare the concrete repair first. Reuse current
authorization for deterministic repairs within the confirmed contract; ask only
for missing decisions, authority or external conditions. Never change acceptance
thresholds or replace required runtime evidence with host results.

Managed `recover` stores branch state beside the existing execution receipt. It
checks the same task/SPEC binding, reserves each attempt before effects, and allows
at most three attempts and 120 seconds per input cycle. Identical failed inputs
require evidenced temporary failure to retry; changed actual inputs or repair
start a new bounded cycle while preserving history. Unsupported rechecks remain
investigation, never success. Existing discussion repair allowances are untouched.
